  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12"><p id="t1">What is it?</p><p id="box">Chemistry is the study of matter, its properties, how and why substances combine or separate to form other substances, and how substances interact with energy. Many people think of chemists as being white-coated scientists mixing strange liquids in a laboratory, but the truth is we are all chemists.</p></div>
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12"><p id="t2">Fields of study</p><p id="box">Within these broad categories are countless fields of study, many of which have important effects on our daily life. Chemists improve many products, from the food we eat and the clothing we wear to the materials with which we build our homes. Chemistry helps to protect our environment and searches for new sources of energy.</p></div>
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sm-12"><p id="t3">Branches</p><p id="box">There are many branches of chemistry or chemistry disciplines. The five main branches are considered to be organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, analytical chemistry, physical chemistry, and biochemistry. There are other ways chemistry can be divided into categories (i.e. polymer chemistry and geochemistry).</p></div>
